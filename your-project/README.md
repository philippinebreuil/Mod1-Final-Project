## Dataset
What are your data sources? 
I have two data sources: 
1. https://www.france-voyage.com/, I've retreived the datas by scapping this website.
2. https://weatherbit.io, I've retreived the datas by connectig to their open API.

How did you transform or merge them into one cohesive and novel dataset?
